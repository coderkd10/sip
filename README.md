# Slide Deck : Predicting Inter-Coded Macroblocks in H.264

This is a slide deck that I prepared in my signal processing class during my foreign exchange semester at [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/).  
We used [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) to prepare the slides and they turned out to be pretty cool. Also the online editor slides.com was pretty easy and fun to use.

## Other decks

During that semester I had to make a lot of presentations on various courses ranging from networks, software engineering, middlewares and even French language; `reveal.js` came in handy in all of those!
